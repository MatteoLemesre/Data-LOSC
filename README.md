This dashboard is a **personal data science project** built to **analyze, compare, and visualize football player performances**.

It is the result of a complete **end-to-end workflow**, including:

- **Web scraping** of detailed player statistics from [FBref.com](https://fbref.com), covering the **Top 5 European leagues** (*Ligue 1, Serie A, Premier League, Liga, Bundesliga*) and the **3 major European cups** (*UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League*), totaling **2100+ matches**.
- **Data cleaning**: standardizing, enriching, and formatting raw scraped data for analysis.
- **Data analysis**: extracting key indicators per position, filtering relevant metrics, and identifying patterns.
- **Custom rating algorithm**: a performance index I personally designed, combining multiple metrics weighted by **position** and **playing time** to deliver a **match-by-match rating**.
- **Percentile-based comparison system**: highlights player strengths by comparing them to their peers on **15 key stats per role**.

This dashboard brings together **statistics**, **visuals**, and **contextual insights**, all tailored for **football analysis** from a **data-driven perspective**.
