Explore the **top Individual Match Performances** across all leagues and positions.

- Start by selecting one or several **positions**.
- Then choose a **statistic** (e.g. assists, interceptions, saves) to rank players by.
- You can filter by **league** and display the **top N performances** based on that stat.
- The table shows each player's value for the selected stat, their **rating**, **minutes played**, **opponent**, and **match score**.
